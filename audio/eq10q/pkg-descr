EQ10Q is an audio plugin bundle over the LV2 standard (http://lv2plug.in)
implementing a powerful and flexible parametric equalizer and more.

All audio processing developed in this project is written in C language and
highly optimized focusing on DSP load reduction yet keeping a superb audio
quality, the audio engine is always working in 64 bits floating point maths but
interfacing with LV2 ports using the standard 32 bits numbers.
